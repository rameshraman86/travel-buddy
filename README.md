### Travel Buddy
You need TWO terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).

In one terminal, cd into react-front-end. Run npm install or yarn to install the dependencies. Then run npm start or yarn start, and go to localhost:5173 in your browser.

In the other terminal, cd into express-back-end. Run npm install or yarn to install the dependencies, then npm start or yarn start to launch the server.

In the browser, you can click on the button and see the data get loaded.
